How-to
======

Images
------


There are two ways to share a picture,   :

	* From the gallery, by opening the share menu to share it to Snapprefs (NOT Snapchat). You will be presented with a tool that will allow you to crop or rotate your picture to fit your needs. (screenshot ?)
	
	* From the Snapchat app, by pressing the share button next to the camera swap button. *screenshot here*

			.. hint:: If you don't see it, enable [Snapchat integration](link to Snapchat integration doc).

			A gallery selector where you'll be able to choose the picture you want to share will appear.

			.. note:: Selecting the picture with this method won't let you crop or rotate your picture).
 
	Afterwards, you will be redirected to Snapchat's sharing screen
	.. warning:: You MUST NOT edit or send your picture at this point !! 
	
	You will need to dismiss the sharing screen (by pressing the X on the upper right of the screen) to go back to the Snapchat camera view.
	Once in the camera view, you must press the round button to take a picture. Instead of displaying the current camera's photo, the picture you chose to share will be shown as if you just took it.

	You may then proceed to add captions, paint or stickers, and customize the viewing time, before adding the snap to your story or sending it to someone.
	
	.. tip:: Sharing through Snapprefs won't add any overlay to your picture, contrarily to sharing a gallery picture directly through Snapchat


Videos
------

Again, you have two ways to share a video :	

	* From the gallery, by opening the share menu to share it to Snapprefs (NOT Snapchat)
	
	* From the Snapchat app, by pressing the share button next to the camera swap button. *image here*

			.. hint:: If you don't see it, enable [Snapchat integration](link to Snapchat integration doc).

			A gallery selector where you'll be able to choose the video you want to share will appear.

 
	Afterwards, you will be redirected to Snapchat's sharing screen
	.. warning:: You MUST NOT edit or send your video at this point !! 
	
	You will need to dismiss the sharing screen (by pressing the X on the upper right of the screen) to go back to the Snapchat camera view.
	Once in the camera view, you must hold the round button to record a video. Instead of displaying the current camera's video, the video you chose to share will be shown as if you just recorded it.

	
After sharing any type of media, you must completely kill (force close) the snapchat app to be able to use it correctly again.
